Lada Belangtoeng Variety Imported from Indonesia in 1947, known for strong growth and resistance to root rot. Slow flowering under low-intensity farming, resulting in lower and unstable yields. Sẻ Black Pepper Varieties Early flowering, high and stable yields in the first few years. Susceptible to quick wilt disease. Common sub-varieties include Sẻ Lộc Ninh, Sẻ Đất Đỏ Bà Rịa, and Sẻ Mỡ Đắk Lắk. Indian Black Pepper Originating from India, with strong growth, medium-sized leaves with wavy edges, early fruiting, and large spikes. Trâu Variety A local variety characterized by large, dark green leaves. Highly resistant to quick wilt but has low and unstable yields. Phú Quốc Variety Originated from Cambodia, well-known for high-quality peppercorns in the 1930s–1940s. Highly susceptible to root diseases, limiting large-scale cultivation. Best Regions in Vietnam for Black Pepper Central Highlands: Đắk Lắk, Gia Lai, Đắk Nông Southeast Region: Bình Phước, Bà Rịa-Vũng Tàu Southwest Region: Phú Quốc 2. Caring Techniques for Black Pepper (Piper nigrum) at Each Development Stage in Vietnam General Care Trellising: Secure vines loosely to avoid restriction. Pruning: First pruning at 10–12 months when vines reach 80–100 cm. Second pruning when vines have 3–5 lateral branches. Irrigation & Drainage Watering Schedule: Dry season: 7–15 days per cycle, depending on soil type. Flowering season: Requires a 30–45-day dry period before watering. Drainage system: Shallow ditches (30 cm deep) between rows. Main drainage channels (60 cm deep, 60 cm wide) at plot edges. 2.1. Nursery Stage Seed Selection Select healthy, disease-free cuttings from high-yielding mother vines (preferably 2-3 nodes long). Disinfect cuttings by soaking them in a fungicide solution (e.g., Bordeaux mixture 1%) before planting. Propagation & Seedling Care Plant cuttings in polybags filled with a mixture of topsoil, compost, and sand (ratio 2:1:1). Provide 50-70% shade and ensure adequate moisture for root development. Apply a light dose of NPK 16-16-8 fertilizer every 3-4 weeks to promote growth. Monitor for damping-off and root rot; use copper-based fungicides if needed. Hardening & Transplant Preparation Gradually expose seedlings to more sunlight (reducing shade to 30-40%) before transplanting. Ensure cuttings have well-developed roots and at least 3-4 healthy leaves before field planting. 2.2. Planting & Early Growth Stage Site Selection & Preparation Choose well-drained, slightly acidic soil (pH 5.5-6.5) with good organic content. Avoid low-lying areas prone to waterlogging to prevent root diseases. Establish support structures (live or dead poles) before planting vines. Planting Process Dig planting holes (40cm x 40cm x 50cm) and mix topsoil with organic compost. Space plants 2.5m x 2.5m or 3m x 3m depending on vine management. Water immediately after planting and mulch around the base to conserve moisture. Initial Training & Support Guide vines onto poles using soft ties to avoid damage. Remove weak or excessive shoots to encourage strong vertical growth. Fertilization & Watering Apply NPK 20-10-10 or composted manure every 2-3 months. Maintain regular watering, especially in the dry season (2-3 times per week). Weed & Disease Control Keep the base weed-free to reduce competition for nutrients. Monitor for root rot, fusarium wilt, and downy mildew; apply fungicides if needed. 2.3. Vegetative Growth & Vine Development Canopy & Vine Management Train vines to grow evenly around the support structure. Prune excess lateral branches to maintain an open, well-ventilated canopy. Nutrient Application Increase nitrogen (N) application to promote vigorous growth. Supplement with micronutrients (zinc, boron, magnesium) to strengthen vines. Irrigation & Mulching Maintain moisture through irrigation during dry periods. Apply organic mulch (dry leaves, coffee husks) to retain soil moisture and regulate temperature. Pest & Disease Prevention Monitor for mealybugs, thrips, and stem borers; use biological control when possible. Prevent fungal infections (e.g., Phytophthora root rot) by ensuring good drainage and applying fungicides when necessary. 2.4. Flowering & Fruit Setting Nutrient Management Switch to NPK 10-10-20 or 12-12-17 to support flowering and fruit development. Apply foliar sprays with boron and calcium to improve fruit set and quality. Pollination & Stress Management Reduce nitrogen application to prevent excessive vegetative growth. Maintain stable soil moisture to prevent flower drop. Pruning & Canopy Maintenance Remove unwanted suckers and excessive growth to improve light penetration. Keep vines well-ventilated to reduce fungal disease risks. Pest & Disease Control Monitor for spike shedding caused by fungal infections. Control thrips, aphids, and mites using organic insecticides when necessary. 2.5. Berry Development & Maturation Watering & Soil Management Provide consistent moisture during fruit development. Avoid excessive watering close to harvest to prevent fungal diseases. Nutrient Application Apply potassium-rich fertilizers (e.g., NPK 12-12-20 or 15-10-25) to improve fruit size and quality. Use well-decomposed manure or compost to enhance soil health. Disease & Pest Control Continue monitoring for root rot and spike drop disease. Protect fruits from berry borers and fungal infections using eco-friendly sprays. 2.6. Harvesting & Post-Harvest Care Harvesting Techniques Harvest when berries turn from green to yellowish-red for maximum quality. Pick only mature spikes to ensure uniform drying and processing. Post-Harvest Processing Dry pepper under the sun or in solar dryers until moisture content reaches 10-12%. Turn drying berries frequently to prevent mold growth. Store dried pepper in airtight bags in a cool, dry place to maintain quality.",

Remove weak or excessive shoots to encourage strong vertical growth. Fertilization & Watering Apply NPK 20-10-10 or composted manure every 2-3 months. Maintain regular watering, especially in the dry season (2-3 times per week). Weed & Disease Control Keep the base weed-free to reduce competition for nutrients. Monitor for root rot, fusarium wilt, and downy mildew; apply fungicides if needed. 2.3. Vegetative Growth & Vine Development Canopy & Vine Management Train vines to grow evenly around the support structure. Prune excess lateral branches to maintain an open, well-ventilated canopy. Nutrient Application Increase nitrogen (N) application to promote vigorous growth. Supplement with micronutrients (zinc, boron, magnesium) to strengthen vines. Irrigation & Mulching Maintain moisture through irrigation during dry periods. Apply organic mulch (dry leaves, coffee husks) to retain soil moisture and regulate temperature. Pest & Disease Prevention Monitor for mealybugs, thrips, and stem borers; use biological control when possible. Prevent fungal infections (e.g., Phytophthora root rot) by ensuring good drainage and applying fungicides when necessary. 2.4. Flowering & Fruit Setting Nutrient Management Switch to NPK 10-10-20 or 12-12-17 to support flowering and fruit development. Apply foliar sprays with boron and calcium to improve fruit set and quality. Pollination & Stress Management Reduce nitrogen application to prevent excessive vegetative growth. Maintain stable soil moisture to prevent flower drop. Pruning & Canopy Maintenance Remove unwanted suckers and excessive growth to improve light penetration. Keep vines well-ventilated to reduce fungal disease risks. Pest & Disease Control Monitor for spike shedding caused by fungal infections. Control thrips, aphids, and mites using organic insecticides when necessary. 2.5. Berry Development & Maturation Watering & Soil Management Provide consistent moisture during fruit development. Avoid excessive watering close to harvest to prevent fungal diseases. Nutrient Application Apply potassium-rich fertilizers (e.g., NPK 12-12-20 or 15-10-25) to improve fruit size and quality. Use well-decomposed manure or compost to enhance soil health. Disease & Pest Control Continue monitoring for root rot and spike drop disease. Protect fruits from berry borers and fungal infections using eco-friendly sprays. 2.6. Harvesting & Post-Harvest Care Harvesting Techniques Harvest when berries turn from green to yellowish-red for maximum quality. Pick only mature spikes to ensure uniform drying and processing. Post-Harvest Processing Dry pepper under the sun or in solar dryers until moisture content reaches 10-12%. Turn drying berries frequently to prevent mold growth. Store dried pepper in airtight bags in a cool, dry place to maintain quality.",

High yield, with spike length averaging 8.9 cm, bulk density 584.9 g/l, and a dry yield per post of 4.25 kg. Grown mainly in Vietnam’s Central and Southern regions. Lada Belangtoeng Variety Imported from Indonesia in 1947, known for strong growth and resistance to root rot. Slow flowering under low-intensity farming, resulting in lower and unstable yields. Sẻ Black Pepper Varieties Early flowering, high and stable yields in the first few years. Susceptible to quick wilt disease. Common sub-varieties include Sẻ Lộc Ninh, Sẻ Đất Đỏ Bà Rịa, and Sẻ Mỡ Đắk Lắk. Indian Black Pepper Originating from India, with strong growth, medium-sized leaves with wavy edges, early fruiting, and large spikes. Trâu Variety A local variety characterized by large, dark green leaves. Highly resistant to quick wilt but has low and unstable yields. Phú Quốc Variety Originated from Cambodia, well-known for high-quality peppercorns in the 1930s–1940s. Highly susceptible to root diseases, limiting large-scale cultivation. Best Regions in Vietnam for Black Pepper Central Highlands: Đắk Lắk, Gia Lai, Đắk Nông Southeast Region: Bình Phước, Bà Rịa-Vũng Tàu Southwest Region: Phú Quốc 2. Caring Techniques for Black Pepper (Piper nigrum) at Each Development Stage in Vietnam General Care Trellising: Secure vines loosely to avoid restriction. Pruning: First pruning at 10–12 months when vines reach 80–100 cm. Second pruning when vines have 3–5 lateral branches. Irrigation & Drainage Watering Schedule: Dry season: 7–15 days per cycle, depending on soil type. Flowering season: Requires a 30–45-day dry period before watering. Drainage system: Shallow ditches (30 cm deep) between rows. Main drainage channels (60 cm deep, 60 cm wide) at plot edges. 2.1. Nursery Stage Seed Selection Select healthy, disease-free cuttings from high-yielding mother vines (preferably 2-3 nodes long). Disinfect cuttings by soaking them in a fungicide solution (e.g., Bordeaux mixture 1%) before planting. Propagation & Seedling Care Plant cuttings in polybags filled with a mixture of topsoil, compost, and sand (ratio 2:1:1). Provide 50-70% shade and ensure adequate moisture for root development. Apply a light dose of NPK 16-16-8 fertilizer every 3-4 weeks to promote growth. Monitor for damping-off and root rot; use copper-based fungicides if needed. Hardening & Transplant Preparation Gradually expose seedlings to more sunlight (reducing shade to 30-40%) before transplanting. Ensure cuttings have well-developed roots and at least 3-4 healthy leaves before field planting. 2.2. Planting & Early Growth Stage Site Selection & Preparation Choose well-drained, slightly acidic soil (pH 5.5-6.5) with good organic content. Avoid low-lying areas prone to waterlogging to prevent root diseases. Establish support structures (live or dead poles) before planting vines.
