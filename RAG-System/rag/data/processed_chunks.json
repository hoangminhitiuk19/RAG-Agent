Remove weak or excessive shoots to encourage strong vertical growth. Fertilization & Watering Apply NPK 20-10-10 or composted manure every 2-3 months. Maintain regular watering, especially in the dry season (2-3 times per week). Weed & Disease Control Keep the base weed-free to reduce competition for nutrients. Monitor for root rot, fusarium wilt, and downy mildew; apply fungicides if needed. 2.3. Vegetative Growth & Vine Development Canopy & Vine Management Train vines to grow evenly around the support structure. Prune excess lateral branches to maintain an open, well-ventilated canopy. Nutrient Application Increase nitrogen (N) application to promote vigorous growth. Supplement with micronutrients (zinc, boron, magnesium) to strengthen vines. Irrigation & Mulching Maintain moisture through irrigation during dry periods. Apply organic mulch (dry leaves, coffee husks) to retain soil moisture and regulate temperature. Pest & Disease Prevention Monitor for mealybugs, thrips, and stem borers; use biological control when possible. Prevent fungal infections (e.g., Phytophthora root rot) by ensuring good drainage and applying fungicides when necessary. 2.4. Flowering & Fruit Setting Nutrient Management Switch to NPK 10-10-20 or 12-12-17 to support flowering and fruit development. Apply foliar sprays with boron and calcium to improve fruit set and quality. Pollination & Stress Management Reduce nitrogen application to prevent excessive vegetative growth.

Physiological Mechanism: Zinc is essential for auxin synthesis; deficiency causes growth deformities. Biological & Regenerative Solutions: Apply zinc-enriched compost or organic foliar sprays. Maintain balanced phosphorus application to avoid Zn lockout. Biological and regenerative solutions should always be prioritized. Chemical methods should be used cautiously only when disease or deficiency levels exceed critical thresholds.",
